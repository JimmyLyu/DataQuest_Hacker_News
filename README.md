<font size='5'>**Hacker News Site- Posts that get the Maximum Comments**</font>






<font size='4'>**Objective**</font>
This is the second guided project from DataQuest.

In this guided project, we want to study posts from Hacker News, the two types of posts we want to look into are:

Ask HN: users submit posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
Show HN: users sumbit posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or something interesting.
The data set is from Kaggle.com

The original data set from Kaggle were extracted in 2016 which contains 300,000 rows , we will only be working with 20,000 rows, since posts without comments were removed and then randomly sampled from the remaining submissions.

For the purpose of this project, we will compare the two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
